# JavaSnakeGame
Made a Java Snake Game that uses JFrame to make the board then uses JPanel to configure the background, size of the window and key listener.
To control the snake it uses key listeners to see if you are hitting "W, A, S, D" or the arrow keys to move the snake.
It will also check to see if the apple has been "eaten" by the snake and then will update the snake accordingly and add to it size.
It is also checking to see if the snake has made any collisions with the border and if the snake hits the border then the screen will change and say "Game Over".
